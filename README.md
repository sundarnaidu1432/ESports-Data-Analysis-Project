# ESports-Data-Analysis-Project
Welcome to **Data Analytics Project** repository! 🚀  
This project focuses on analyzing ESports data across various countries and regions to understand trends, player distribution, and overall performance.  

During the project, I identified data quality issues in some column, where some values were incorrect. To maintain data accuracy, I replaced the invalid columns with nearest values based on records. In real life project Discussions made by the teammates and then take approval from Team head And Data engineer to made changes.  

### 🧹 Data Cleaning and Transformation:  
**Changes made in Power Query to enhance data quality:**
- 🧩 Corrected data types (e.g., dates, numbers, and text)
- 🔄 Removed duplicates and handled missing values
- 🧮 Replaced invalid entries with nearest valid data
- 📅 Standardized date and text formats for consistency

### 🧠 Measures and Calculations:
**Created several DAX measures to calculate:**
- 👩‍🎓 Total Active Players
- 🎥 Revenue Generated
- 📊 Total Gaming Companies
- 🚻 How many countries Participated Across the region
- 📅 Yearly Trends
 
### 📊 Dashboard and Insights:
**Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard containing:**
- 🧾 Card visuals for key metrics
- 📈 Charts for yearly active players and revenue 
- 🎯 Filters and slicers for user-driven insights
 
This project helped me enhance my data analysis, data handling, and Power BI visualization skills. I learned to create various card visuals and analyze patterns effectively to generate meaningful insights.
